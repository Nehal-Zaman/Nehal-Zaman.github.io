# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to our journey into [Timelapse](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/452)! 

First up, we'll explore how `WinRM` lets us in without needing a password, giving us a basic level of control over the system. 

Next, we'll learn about finding secret credentials hidden in the system, which can help us move up to more powerful user accounts. 

Finally, we'll dive into `LAPS`, a tool that helps us find the keys to the kingdom by revealing local administrator passwords. 

So get ready for a adventure as we go through these key concepts together!

```

We started our exploration by using `Rustscan` to scan the IP address. 

Rustscan identified several open ports on the target system: `53`, `88`, `135`, `139`, `389`, `445`, `464`, `3268`, `3269`, `5986`, `9389`, `49667`, `49673`, `49674`, `49739`, and `58278`.

```

Afterward, we used `Nmap` to delve deeper into the services running on these ports. 

Nmap revealed detailed information about each open port, including the services and versions running on them.

From the results, it became apparent that the target system was likely part of an `Active Directory` environment, which hints at the presence of Windows-based systems and services.

# ENUMERATING RPC

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb]
â””â”€$ rpcclient -U="" 10.10.11.152
Password for [WORKGROUP\]:
rpcclient $> srvinfo
        10.10.11.152   Wk Sv PDC Tim NT     
        platform_id     :       500
        os version      :       10.0
        server type     :       0x80102b
rpcclient $>
```

We attempted to explore the Remote Procedure Call (`RPC`) interface using the `rpcclient` tool on the IP address. Surprisingly, we were able to access the `RPC` without providing any username or password.

```shell
rpcclient $> getusrdompwinfo
Usage: getusrdompwinfo rid
rpcclient $> createdomuser nehal
result was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> deletedomuser administrator
result was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> enumdomains
result was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> enumdomgroups
result was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> querydispinfo
result was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> netshareenum
result was WERR_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> netshareenumall
result was WERR_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $>
```

Upon accessing the `RPC`, we used various commands like `srvinfo` to gather information about the server. 

However, when we tried commands such as `getusrdompwinfo`, `createdomuser`, `deletedomuser`, `enumdomains`, `enumdomgroups`, `querydispinfo`, `netshareenum`, and `netshareenumall` to retrieve user-related data and other information, we encountered an `NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` error message. This indicates that while we could access the `RPC`, we lacked the necessary permissions to execute these commands.

It became evident that we required valid credentials to obtain data from the `RPC` effectively.

# ENUMERATING SMB

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb]
â””â”€$ echo exit | smbclient -L \\\\10.10.11.152

Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.10.11.152 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

To gather information about the available shares on the target system, we used the `smbclient` tool. 

`smbclient` displayed several shares including `ADMIN$`, `C$`, `IPC$`, `NETLOGON`, `Shares`, and `SYSVOL`. Among these, the `Shares` share drew our attention due to its odd nature.

```shell

```

We went on to explore the contents of the `Shares` share using `smbclient`. 

Within this share, we discovered two directories: `Dev` and `HelpDesk`. In the `Dev` directory, we identified a file named `winrm_backup.zip`. Additionally, the `HelpDesk` directory contained various `docx` files and an `LAPS` MSI installer, indicating the possible usage of **LAPS** (`Local Administrator Password Solution`) in the system.

We transferred the contents of both directories to our local machine.

# WINRM PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb]
â””â”€$ unzip winrm_backup.zip 
Archive:  winrm_backup.zip
[winrm_backup.zip] legacyy_dev_auth.pfx password: 
password incorrect--reenter: 
password incorrect--reenter: 
   skipping: legacyy_dev_auth.pfx    incorrect password
```

We started by trying to open a protected file `winrm_backup.zip`, but it needed a password that we didn't know.

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb]
â””â”€$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt winrm_backup.zip.hash

Session completed.
```

To get into this file, we used `John` along with `rockyou.txt`. Eventually, we found the password. 

Inside the file, we found something called `legacyy_dev_auth.pfx`, which looked like a certificate. We guessed it might be used for logging into `WinRM` without needing a password.

By default, `WinRM` uses **Basic Authentication** to authenticate users which is not very secure. For a better secure option, `WinRM` also supports **Certificate-based Authentication** that leverages digital certificates to verify usersâ€™ identities, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and manage remote systems. Learn more about WinRM passwordless authentication [here](https://medium.com/r3d-buck3t/certificate-based-authentication-over-winrm-13197265c790).

```

To utilize the certificate for authentication, we needed to convert it into two separate files: a `PEM` file and a `CRT` file. However, this process required the passphrase used to create the certificate. To find this passphrase, we performed a targeted password cracking attempt using a customized wordlist from `rockyou.txt` containing variations of the term `legacy`.

Our strategy proved successful, as we managed to crack the passphrase, allowing us to generate the necessary `PEM` and `CRT` files for passwordless authentication.

```shell

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb/timelapse]
â””â”€$
```

With these files generated, we were equipped to proceed with passwordless authentication via `WinRM`.

# SHELL AS LEGACYY

To authenticate over `WinRM`, we had the certificates ready, but we still needed a valid username.

Looking closely at the filename `legacyy_dev_auth.pfx`, we noticed that the word `legacyy` had an extra `y`. This could have been a mistake during certificate creation, or it might actually be a valid username.

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/ctf/htb/timelapse]

We decided to try logging in using the username `legacyy` with the help of `evil-winrm`, as port `5986` was open instead of the standard port `5985` (normally used for `WinRM`). Surprisingly, our attempt was successful.

This allowed us to gain access to the system as the user `legacyy`.

In the user `legacyy`'s `PowerShell` history, we found the credentials for a service account named `svc_deploy`. Since we have access to `legacyy`'s shell, we can use `BloodHound` to understand more about the `Active Directory` environment.

We used `SharpHound` to ingest data and copied it to our local machine.

![](/assets/images/writeups/timelapse/1.png)

As we had valid credentials for `svc_deploy`, we explored the shortest path from the `svc_deploy` account to the `administrator` account. We discovered that the `svc_deploy` user is part of the `LAPS_READERS` group, which has the privilege `ReadLAPSPassword` on the `dc01.timelapse.htb` domain.

`LAPS`, or **Local Administrator Password Solution**, is a Microsoft tool designed to solve the problem of using the same local administrator password across multiple machines in an Active Directory domain. Each computer managed by `LAPS` has its own unique local administrator password, securely stored and managed by Active Directory. Learn more about `LAPS` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview).

Members of the `LAPS_READERS@TIMELAPSE.HTB` group can read the passwords set by `LAPS` on the computer `DC01.TIMELAPSE.HTB`. The local administrator password is stored in the confidential **LDAP** attribute `ms-mcs-AdmPwd`.

```powershell
# Create a credential object
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'compromised_user_password123' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('compromised_user', $SecPassword)

# load powerview
Get-DomainObject windows1 -Credential $Cred -Properties "ms-mcs-AdmPwd",name
```

Although we attempted to use [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to retrieve the `LAPS` password, we encountered issues due to antivirus restrictions. Instead, we utilized [PyLAPS](https://github.com/p0dalirius/pyLAPS) from our attacker machine to extract the `LAPS` password.

```shell

```

Finally, armed with the `LAPS` password, we successfully logged in as `administrator` using `Evil-WinRM`.

# CONCLUSION

In the end, our journey through the box showed the power of careful searching and problem-solving. 

We started by finding a `zip` file on `SMB` and uncovered a special certificate inside that helped us log in without a password using WinRM. 

After converting some files from the zip, we got access as user `legacyy`. 

From there, we found secret login details for `svc_deploy`, a user with special permissions to read `LAPS` passwords. By using these details, we grabbed the `LAPS` password and upgraded our access to full control over the system as an `administrator`.

This marks the conclusion of our adventure on this box. 

Thank you for accompanying this far, and looking forward to sharing more exploitations in the next one. Until next time!
